In this folder you can find diferent versions of the model used during the thesis ( some changes must be made according if you want to use rotated bbox or not ).

The given json files are the ones to be used for the rotated bounding box approach where rotation angle is given, and rotated bbox coordinates are used.

The reformat json files are used to obtain the proper json files to use given the original object data files, in each version you can find the differences explained.

I also include all other files needed for training and using the model, TESTER is the program to use the trained model.
